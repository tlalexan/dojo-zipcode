             INTRO TO CODING DOJO

TDD - Test Driven Development
   - Why?
      - Universal technique to push the ball forward
      - Climbing with Ropes
   - The cycle: Red - Green - Refactor

Katas:
   - Why?  
      - Performance vs Practice
   - How?
   	  - Start from scratch
   	  - Follow TDD

The problem for today: Poker Hands http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataPokerHands

Dojos:
   - Group Activity to do Katas
   - Randori Style Rules 
   	  - Rotation every 5 minutes
   	  - Driver/Navigator pairing
   	  - Driver leaves, Navigator becomes Driver, new Navigator from group
   	  - When RED: Only the driver navigator pair can speak
   	  - When GREEN: Everyone can make suggestions
